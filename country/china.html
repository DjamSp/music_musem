                    <p class="content2">The history of Chinese music goes back thousands of years. In ancient times, back in the Shang and Zhou eras, music was closely associated with rituals and religious rituals, accompanying sacrifices and solemn ceremonies. The sounds of bells, drums, and bamboo flutes resounded in temples and palaces, paying homage to the gods and ancestors.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p class="content3">In the Qin era (221-206 BC), music became more secular, with orchestras and ensembles being created at the imperial court to perform complex works for the emperors and the aristocracy. In the Han era (206 BC — 220 AD), Chinese music absorbs the influence of other cultures, expanding its genres and instruments, making music more refined and diverse.</p>

                        <p>The golden age of Chinese music began during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), when poetry, performing arts, and musical styles flourished. During this period, magnificent works inspired by nature, love and philosophy were created. In the Song era (960-1279), music became more accessible to the general public: folk songs, theatrical performances, and music competitions gained popularity.</p>
                        <p>After the Mongol conquest (1279-1368), Chinese music was influenced by nomadic peoples, which led to the emergence of new genres and instruments, and music became more dynamic and expressive. During the Ming era (1368-1644), traditional culture was revived, and opera and instrumental music reached new heights.</p>  
                        <p>During the Manchu Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), Chinese music incorporated elements of Western classics and opera, creating new genres and forms of performance. Today, despite the rapid development of technology and the influence of world culture, Chinese traditional music retains its identity and continues to inspire new generations of musicians and listeners. Large-scale festivals are held in modern China, new ensembles and orchestras are being created, and innovative methods of performance and popularization are being actively introduced. Government programs, private schools, and online platforms help ensure that this unique culture does not disappear and continues to live, resonating with people around the world.</p>

                    <p>The genres of Chinese traditional music are a real kaleidoscope reflecting the richness and diversity of the national culture. Among them are folk songs that tell about love, work, joys and sorrows of ordinary people, uniting them into a single cultural space. Operas are a theatrical art that combines singing, acting, acrobatics and stage effects, telling myths, legends and historical events.</p>
                    <p>Court music is a symbol of the grandeur and grace of the imperial court, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and peace. Ritual music is designed to connect the human world with the spiritual space, evoking reverence and a prayerful atmosphere. Theatrical music includes a variety of genres, from folk songs to complex orchestral compositions that create a vibrant stage atmosphere and emotional tension.</p>

                    <p>Genres such as Yue Yuan, Xinyu, Pingchuan and quyi occupy a special place — each of them has its own special historical basis, style of performance and emotional coloring. Yue Yuan is a melancholic, moonlit melody that conveys the beauty of nature and inner feelings.</p>
                    <p>Xinyu is the music of the heart, subtle and sincere, expressing unspoken emotions. Pingchuan is a folk genre known for its vivacity and cheerful rhythm, performed at festivals and weddings. Quyi are song arts related to oral folk art, telling fairy tales, legends and myths, saturated with meaning and symbolism.</p>
                    <p>The modern development of Chinese music is supported by the state, which finances research, restoration and performance of traditional works. Educational programs are underway, schools and ensembles are being created, and popularization is taking place through media and festivals.</p>
                    <p>Young people are attracted to traditional music through the integration of its elements into modern genres, films, TV series and popular projects. This process contributes to the preservation and development of cultural heritage, making it relevant and modern.</p>
