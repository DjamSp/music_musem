                <p>The first musical sounds are human imitations of animal and bird voices during hunting. By using the vocal cords, 
                a person could already reproduce sounds in a wide range: from the singing of exotic birds and the chirping of insects to the roar of a wild animal.</p>
                <p>The oldest song, according to scientists, is about 2,000 years old, and it was found written on a clay tablet during excavations in Nippur.
                Additionally, research on ancient drawings on walls and ceramics suggests that music was already evolving into a form of polyphony. 
                The flute, one of the oldest musical instruments created by humans, played a melody, while a second flute provided a background or second voice</p>
                <p>The prototypes of the flute were discovered during excavations in southwestern Germany,
                dating back to the period 35-40 thousand years BC.</p>

            <h2>The Middle Ages </h2>
            <h3>(5th–15th centuries)</h3>
        </div>
            <div class="text">
            <p class="content2">In the Middle Ages, there were two main directions in the development of music: sacred music and secular, entertaining music. 
            At the same time, secular music was condemned by religion and considered a "devilish obsession."
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
            <p class="content3">The source of medieval sacred music was the monastic environment. 
            Chants were learned in singing schools by ear and spread in the church environment. 
            Due to the emergence of a wide variety of melodies, the Catholic Church decided to canonize and regulate chants that reflected the unity of Christian doctrine
            </p>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <p>They were intended to purify a person's mind from emotions and bring them closer to God, which is why the church imposed a ban on musical instruments, which was quite logical for the Middle Ages. "God created man as an instrument (man is God's flute), so we don't need any flutes or violins," was the church's position.
                This is how the choral music emerged, becoming the epitome of the church's musical tradition. It is based on genres such as the Mass, antiphon and mystery, created specifically for certain holidays and divine services.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 11th century, there was a surge of interest in musical culture. This is due to important discoveries in this field, such as the appearance of a kind of musical notation. Guido of Arezzo created a new type of manuscripts on which it was possible to place notes according to the scale. Previously, musicians used only special signs (neumes) that showed the movement of the melody down or up.
                Mimes, jugglers, troubadours or trouvers, minstrels (in France), minnesingers, shpilmans (in German countries), hoglars (in Spain) performed secular music. These artists had to not only be able to sing, play and dance, but also be able to perform circus performances, magic tricks, theatrical scenes, and had to entertain the audience in every possible way.</p>  
                <p>Trouvers, troubadours and minnesingers playing courtly chivalrous music have created their own original genres: "Weaving" and "May" songs, rondo, ballad, virelle, heroic epic, crusader songs, canzone.</p>
                <p>Due to the fact that music was one of the sciences and was taught at Universities, feudal lords and noble people who received education could apply their knowledge in art. Thus, music developed in the court environment. In contrast to Christian asceticism, chivalrous music celebrated sensual love and the ideal. A beautiful Lady.</p>

            <h2>Renaissance</h2>
            <h3>(16th century)</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content1">
            <div class="text">
                <p>This period got its name in connection with the revival of interest in ancient art, which became an ideal for cultural figures of the new age. The texture of the works changes, the number of voices increases to four, six or more. Consonantal consonances prevail in harmony, the use of dissonances is strictly limited by special rules. The major and minor frets and the clock system of rhythmics characteristic of later music are formed.</p>
                <p>The stylistic characteristics defining Renaissance music are a polyphonic texture that obeys the laws of counterpoint and is regulated by the modal system of Gregorian chant inherited from the Middle Ages.</p>

            <div class="text">
            <p>Over the course of a century, the technique of imitation has been perfected — when one voice repeats or develops a theme heard in another. Gradually, more complex forms such as canon and fugue were formed, which became a significant step forward in the development of musical thought. </p>
            <p>At the same time, secular music was developing, especially in Italy, where the madrigal became a popular genre. The madrigal was distinguished by its free form, variety of expressive means and high melodic beauty. This contributed to the development of the composers' skills in conveying emotions and nuances through music.</p>
            <p>An important stage was the spread of musical notation and printed publications, which significantly increased the availability of music and accelerated its development. Musicians and composers had the opportunity to exchange works, learn from the best masters and develop their own skills. Composers began to write more complex and technically demanding works for new instruments such as harpsichord, organ and lute.</p>

            <h2>Baroque</h2>
            <h3>(XVII — the first half of the XVIII century)</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content1">
            <div class="text">
                <p>During the Baroque era, important changes took place in musical thinking: polyphonic polyphony was replaced by a homophonic-harmonic system, which contributed to the development of improvisation. The musical content expanded — in addition to the mass and lyrics, mournful and tragic images appeared.</p>
                <p>At this time, the personality of the composer, who worked in various genres, was formed. Opera became the main form, and the oratorio reached the top with Bach and Handel. Virtuoso forms such as toccatas and fugues developed, and a genre of concerto appeared, both for one instrument and orchestra, and an ensemble concerto.</p>  
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content4">
            <div class="text">
            <p>The organ became the main instrument of the era, as well as the harpsichord, strings and woodwinds. The first orchestras and instrumental music appeared. Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi created the recitative style and developed Italian opera, which became the center of a new style.</p>
            <p>Italy became a cultural center, and the Catholic Church used music to spread faith, emphasizing the legibility of the text and the development of homophony. In the mature Baroque, the separation of musical forms intensified and the circle of listeners expanded due to the printing and exchange of works.</p>

            <div class="text">
            <p>Harmony and systematization of musical education have become important areas. Arcangelo Corelli developed the genre of Concerto grosso, based on contrasts and the alternation of loud and quiet parts. In England, Henry Purcell's talent was clearly evident, working in various genres — from religious hymns to stage music.</p>
            <p>Two styles have emerged in music — homophonic and polyphonic, and forms such as concert, suite, sonata, opera, and ballet have matured. The following schemes have become generally accepted: two-part, three-part and rondo. The Baroque era was a time of rich changes and the development of musical culture.</p>

            <div class="content8">            
                <p>Classicism was based on the belief in the reasonableness of existence and a single order governing nature and human nature. The work should be built according to strict canons, reflecting the harmony and logic of the universe. Classicism divided genres into "high" ones related to antiquity and religion (tragedies, odes), and "low" ones reflecting folk life (fables, comedies), while mixing them was unacceptable.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text">
            <div class="content1">
                <p>In the middle of the 18th century, new genres of instrumental music emerged — sonata, symphony, concerto, and the sonata-symphonic form was formed. Types of chamber ensembles have emerged, such as trios and quartets. The sonata form was finally formed by Haydn and Mozart and reached perfection by Beethoven, which includes three parts: exposition, elaboration and reprise. The symphony usually consisted of four movements: fast, slow, minuet and finale. The concerto is a work for orchestra and soloist, with the traditional three—movement structure (fast, slow, fast), anchored by Haydn and Mozart. The string quartet has become a popular genre of chamber music.</p>

            <div class="content8">            
                <p>In the 18th century, Italian opera dominated, especially the opera seria, created by Metastasio, with a minimal number of characters and without a chorus. France developed tragic opera and opera buffa, which by 1750 had taken an important place on the stage, displacing serious operas. Music remained important in churches, but secular culture and dramatization penetrated into church works, sometimes transferring them from sacred to secular genres.</p>

                <p>Classicism combined simplicity and clarity with deep content, strong feelings and drama. This style became the basis for modern academic music and continues to have a significant influence on music today.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p class="content2">Musical romanticism, which emerged in the second decade of the 19th century, was an innovative phenomenon with deep connections with the classics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p class="content3">The predecessors were Beethoven, Cherubini, and Gluck. The works of the Romantics revealed their idea, structure and development. Music has become more emotional, expressive and individual, especially in song genres.</p>

            <div class="content1">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The main theme of romantic music was personality, its conflict with the outside world. The hero is a lonely and extraordinary person, often a poet, musician or artist. The theme of loneliness and creative personality has become central, as in the works of Schumann, Berlioz and Liszt. The theme of lyrical confession, closely related to nature, which conveyed an inner state often tinged with a sense of disharmony, also became important. The idea of fiction developed in genre and epic symphonism, for the first time musically depicting fabulous and fantastic images using unusual orchestral and harmonic colors — an example is the scene in the Wolf Gorge from Weber's The Magic Arrow.</p>
                <p>Interest in folk art has become a characteristic feature of Romanticism. The composers widely used folk songs, ballads and epics, based on the intonations and rhythms of national folklore, revived the ancient diatonic modes. This led to the transformation of European music, the expansion of musical language and formation, the development of melody, speech intonation, timbre and harmonic palette.</p>  
                <p>The focus is no longer on the collective humanity, but on an individual with his unique feelings. This resulted in a decrease in generalized intonations, typical chord progressions, and textures that became more individual. In orchestration, preference is given to solo voices and ensembles give way to solo expressive sound.</p>

                <p>The industrial Revolution in the 19th century significantly influenced the development of music, primarily due to the improvement of musical instruments, which expanded the possibilities of composers to experiment with sound. Musical reproduction was also invented and developed — the phonograph and gramophone, which made music accessible to a wide range of listeners and opened up new horizons for the search for new sound ideas.</p>
                <p>The emerging impressionism in music sought to convey impressions and sensations, creating soft atmospheric soundscapes. Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel became one of the leading composers of this genre.</p>
                <p>Expressionism, which emerged at the beginning of the 20th century, was an experimental approach to expressing inner emotions. Arnold Schoenberg introduced a twelve-tone system based on the equality of all 12 sounds, which opened up new harmonic possibilities. Modernism of this time gave musicians freedom from tradition and gave rise to many new styles and trends that are relevant in modern art.</p>
                <p>The 20th century was an era of revolutionary changes in music. New styles are emerging, such as jazz, blues, rock, electronic music, avant-garde, and experimental styles. The development of recording, radio, and television technologies has radically changed the way music is distributed and consumed. Important events were the creation of the first phonograph, vinyl records, and later digital formats and the Internet, which made music accessible to millions of people around the world. At this time, many new genres are emerging, combining different cultures and styles, as well as the development of festivals, concerts and online music platforms.</p>
                <p>Classical music of the 20th century has experienced significant changes and experiments. Composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Bela Bartok and Dmitry Shostakovich have made significant contributions to the development of this genre. Igor Stravinsky became famous for his revolutionary ballets such as Sacred Spring and Petrushka, which reflected the modern artistic and musical trends of their time. Sergei Prokofiev combined elements of classicism, experimental sound effects and emotional depth in his works. His art has a unique style and unusual harmonies. Bela Bartok and Dmitry Shostakovich have made significant contributions to the development of modern classical music by combining folk melodies and rhythms with innovative harmonies and structures.</p>
                <p>Postmodernism and the influence of technology have led to the emergence of electronic music and new genres. The use of electronics, sampling, and computer software has given musicians the opportunity to create, record, and distribute music independently of major record labels. Trance, house and dubstep became popular genres, which actively influenced youth culture and musical taste.</p>
